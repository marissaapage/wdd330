                <li>I really enjoyed the video about how important it is to code your website for mobile first. All of the classes I have taken so far have had me do mobile first and then make then responsive, so this was definitely an eye opener. Because that was the way I was taught, I never would have thought to do it mobile first, but it's so true that everything is mobile now, and that is the direction things will continue to go.</li>
