            <p>This week was fun, we got to play a lot with arrays that we read about last week. below is the result of some code we worked on in class. For the team assignment, we made tic tac toe, but I also did a tic tac toe program with binary in my second semester of college. If you'd like to check that out, click the link below. (PS it was designed for computer screen, not mobile)</p>
